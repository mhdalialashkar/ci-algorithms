# Using Genetic Algorithm to model Chromosome Collision

## Team Members:
- Mohammad Ali Al-Ashkar (94122681004)

## Descreption:
Routing and Chromosome generation using Genetic Algorithm

This project simulates the prediction work for maps

##Algorithm:
The algorithms used here are to designate the principle and destination and manufacture the chromosome from the principle to the destination by generating random genes and examining the path.

##input and output:
Input is randomly assigned and the output is displayed as fees
